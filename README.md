# CSC 230 - Computer Organization & Assembly Language

Welcome to my CSC230 repository! This repository contains projects from my CSC 230 course: Computer Organization and Assembly Language, taken at Scottsdale Community College, taught by Professor Meacham.

## Course Description

CSC 230 is a course that covers the fundamentals of computer organization, assembly language programming, and computer system hardware. It introduces students to the basic principles of computer architecture, assembly language programming, and the interaction between hardware and software components.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a mix of labs, assignments, tutorials, demos, and other projects completed during the CSC 230 course. All code is written in **MIPS assembly language**, focusing on the following topics:

- Data representation
- Instruction sets and addressing modes
- Assembly language programming
- Input/output operations
- Subroutines and function calls
- Interrupts and exception handling
- Memory organization and management
- Hardware components and their interactions

## Getting Started

To work with the MIPS assembly code in this repository, you will need an assembly language compiler, assembler, or development environment that supports MIPS assembly. In this course, we used the [MARS MIPS simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/) from Missouri State University. MARS is a lightweight MIPS simulator that provides a convenient integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, assembling, and simulating MIPS assembly programs.

Please refer to the MARS MIPS simulator documentation for instructions on how to set up the environment, load the code, and run the programs.

## Disclaimer

These projects are provided for educational purposes only. While the code is free to use, modify, or distribute, please do not use it to directly copy or plagiarize assignments for your coursework. Instead, use the material as a reference to help you understand the concepts and techniques involved in MIPS assembly language programming.
